# Windows Timeline Support - Web Extension

## Introduction
Windows Timeline Support is a web extension that integrates Windows Timeline support into popular browsers. This is done by publishing your browsing history as activities to the Microsoft Graph (so a Microsoft Account is required to use this extension). Personal Microsoft Accounts are confirmed to work, work and school accounts should work.
